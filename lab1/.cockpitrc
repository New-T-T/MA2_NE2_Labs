[library]
  # Setup files will be generated for these libraries.
  # 
  # - only libraries that can be found in the "kit.ascii" database
  #   can be used (see cockpit.log for the full unix path)
  #   Standard cells, Low VT (fast), Regular VT and High VT (slow) are possible.
  #   Note that you can mix and match all VTs.. 
  # - use "-update" or "-rewrite" for the changes to take effect  
  #
  # The following libraries are available:
  #   designkit     :  xp018_v6_1_1                (all Metals)
  #  
  
  libs    = xp018_v6_1_1

 
  # send an e-mail to <kgf@ee.ethz.ch> to ask for macros. Currently available
  # macro datasheets are available under:
  #   /usr/pack/

[version]
  # Setup files will be generated for these software versions. 
  # - only versions that can be found in the "kit.ascii" database
  #   can be used (see cockpit.log for the full unix path)
  # - if you change a version you might need to adjust some
  #   startups in the [command] section too... 
  # - use "-update" or "-rewrite" for the changes to take effect  

  # WARNING: The primary purpose is to keep version settings within each
  # project. Fiddling around will most likely result in an unsupported
  # combinations and perl errors. Better update this file as a whole
  # with '-updaterc'.

[command]
  # Startup commands available through the GUI buttons.
